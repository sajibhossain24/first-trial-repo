        <p>Bangladesh: বাংলাদেশ, pronounced [ˈbaŋlaˌdeʃ] (About this soundlisten)), officially the People's Republic of
            Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most populous country in the world, with a
            population exceeding 163 million people, in an area of 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi), making it
            one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the
            west, north, and east, Myanmar to the southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It is narrowly
            separated from Nepal and Bhutan by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim in
            the north, respectively. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political, and
            cultural hub. Chittagong, the largest seaport is the second-largest city.</p>
